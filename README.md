Car Rental Project C++
A car rental is a service that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period. 
Getting a rental car helps people get around despite the fact they do not have access to their 
own personal vehicle or don't own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car must 
contact a rental car company and contract out for a vehicle. This system increases customer 
retention and simplify vehicle and staff management. 
Detailed study of existing systems will be done. Installation and hand on experience on 
existing approaches of the car rental systems like zoom car will be done. Relative pros and 
cons will be identified. Various parameters will be identified to evaluate the proposed 
system. Comparison of new implemented approach with exiting approaches will be done. 
Car rental business has emerged with a new goody compared to the past experience where 
every activity concerning car rental business is limited to a physical location only. Even 
though the physical location has not been totally eradicated; the nature of functions 
and how these functions are achieved has been reshaped by the power of internet. Nowadays, 
customers can reserve cars online, rent car online, and have the car brought to their door step 
once the customer is a registered member or go to the office to pick the car.
